# Drivers

Fuchsiaâ€™s [driver framework][dfv2] is a collection of libraries, tools, metadata,
and components that enable developers to create, run, test, and distribute drivers
for Fuchsia systems. The driver framework aims to provide a stable ABI that allows
developers to write a driver once and deploy it on multiple versions of the Fuchsia
platform. (However, Fuchsia's driver framework is constantly evolving and has not
achieved ABI stability yet.)

Fuchsia has a new version of the driver framework (DFv2). For more information
on DFv2-specific concepts, see [Drivers][dfv2-concepts] under the **Fundamentals**
section.
