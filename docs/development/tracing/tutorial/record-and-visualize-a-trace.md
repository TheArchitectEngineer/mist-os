# Record and visualize a trace

This page describes how to record and visualize a trace on a Fuchsia
device with the [Fuchsia tracing system][fuchsia-trace-system].

## Prerequisites

Important: Tracing is only enabled for `core` and `eng` build types in Fuchsia
images. Make sure that the Fuchsia image you use is of `core` or `eng` build type.
In other words, if you're to build a Fuchsia image from the Fuchsia source checkout
or download a Fuchsia prebuilt image, make sure that the image's build type is
**not** `user` or `userdebug`.

Many existing Fuchsia components are already registered as trace providers, whose
trace data often provide a sufficient overview of the system. For this reason,
if you only need to record a general trace (for instance, to include details
in a bug report), you may proceed to the sections below. However, if you want
to collect additional, customized trace events from a specific component, you need
to complete the following tasks first:

* [Register your component as a trace provider][register-a-trace-provider]
* [Add tracing in your component's code][add-tracing-in-your-code]

## Record a trace {:#record-a-trace}

To record a trace on a Fuchsia device from your host machine,
run the following command:

```posix-terminal
ffx trace start --duration <SECONDS>
```

This command starts a trace with the default settings, capturing
a general overview of the target device.

The trace continues for the specified duration (or until the `ENTER` key
is pressed if a duration is not specified). When the trace is finished, the
trace data is automatically saved to the `trace.fxt` file in the
current directory (which can be changed by specifying the `--output` flag;
for example, `ffx trace start --output <FILE_PATH>`). To visualize the trace
results stored in this file, see the [Visualize a trace](#visualize-a-trace)
section below.

Note: For more details on the `ffx trace` commands and options, see
[Record traces for performance analysis][record-traces].

## Visualize a trace {:#visualize-a-trace}

[Fuchsia trace format][fuchsia-trace-format] (`.fxt`) is Fuchsia's
binary format that directly encodes the original trace data. To
visualize an `.fxt` trace file, you can use the
[Perfetto viewer][perfetto-viewer]{:.external}.

Do the following:

1. Visit the [Perfetto viewer][perfetto-viewer]{:.external}
   site on a web browser.
2. Click **Open trace file** on the navigation bar.
3. Select your `.fxt` file from the host machine.

This viewer also allows you to use SQL to
[query the trace data][perfetto-trace-processor]{:.external}.

## Categories

Categories allow you to control which events you want to see. For example:

- Trace with all the default categories as well as "cat":

```posix-terminal
  ffx trace start --categories '#default,cat'
```

- Trace with no defaults, only scheduler and thread/process data:

```posix-terminal
  ffx trace start --categories "kernel:sched,kernel:meta"
```

### Useful categories

#### kernel:sched + kernel:meta

High granularity overview of what is running on each CPU

#### kernel:ipc

Emit an event for each FIDL call and connect them with flows

#### kernel:syscall

Emit an event for every syscall system wide

#### gfx
