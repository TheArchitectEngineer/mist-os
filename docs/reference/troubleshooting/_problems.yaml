  key: Runtime Observation
  use_case: |
    I want to understand what my component is doing at runtime.
  tools:
  - Inspect
  - Logs
  - Structured Logs
  - Tracing
  - zxdb
  description: |
    It is often useful to be able to look at what your component is
    actually doing when it runs on a system. Fuchsia, like most
    systems, supports [Logging][Logs] so components may provide
    human-readable output on their state. Logs may be augmented with
    [Structured Data][Structured Logs] that is typed and can be
    aggregated by other tools.

    Fuchsia components have the unique ability to publish their
    ongoing state for inspection using the [Inspect feature][Inspect].
    Generally, Inspect tells you what your component is doing <i>right
    now</i> while Logs tell you how you got there. Both are useful
    to have a comprehensive view of component status.

  key: Snapshot Triage
  use_case: |
    I want to automatically post-process snapshots to identify notable
    values or error conditions
  tools:
  - Triage
  description: |
    Fuchsia Feedback Snapshots contain a lot of data about what was
    happening on a Fuchsia device, and often the volume of data makes
    it difficult to really see what is happening on the device at a
    high level.

    The [Automatic Triage Tool][Triage] is a system for applying a
    series of rules to a snapshot to extract useful data. This
    includes top-level gauges (which display values from the system,
    such as memory usage) and alerts (which describe some condition
    identified on the system). The system is fully configurable on
    a per-product or per-component basis and is available for local
    use as well.

  key: Trigger Snapshot
  use_case: |
    I want to automatically trigger taking a snapshot on a specific condition
  tools:
  - Detect
  description: |
    When things go wrong on devices, it is useful to understand what
    was happening at that moment in time. [Detect][Detect] is basically
    a version of [Triage][Triage] that works on device. Like Triage,
    it supports producing warnings based on the state of the device.
    Unlike off-device Triage, Detect supports a new action type that
    files a crash report containing a snapshot when the condition
    is detected.

  key: Trace a function
  use_case: |
    I want to measure the runtime of specific functions
  tools:
  - Tracing
  description: |
    Fuchsia's tracing system offers a comprehensive way to collect,
    aggregate, and visualize diagnostic tracing information from the
    Fuchsia user space processes and the Zircon kernel. Traces, like
    logs, represent events from a Fuchsia system, but are fine grained,
    higher frequency and are meant for machine consumption to compute
    other insights and visualizations.

  key: Collect metrics from devices
  use_case: |
    I want to collect metrics from user-owned devices in the field
  tools:
  - Cobalt
  description: |
    Cobalt is a pipeline for collecting metrics data from user-owned devices in
    the field and producing aggregated reports.

    Cobalt includes a suite of features for preserving user privacy and
    anonymity while giving product owners the data they need to improve their
    products.
