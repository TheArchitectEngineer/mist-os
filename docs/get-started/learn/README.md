# Get started with Fuchsia

Fuchsia is a modern open source operating system that’s simple, secure,
updatable, and performant. It provides core operating system functions like
system resource management, a driver framework, and software abstractions.
Fuchsia is a general purpose operating system designed to power a diverse
ecosystem of hardware and software.

As Fuchsia is an open source project, you can contribute to the Fuchsia source
tree. Before you begin contributing, it’s recommended that you learn about the
fundamentals of the Fuchsia platform to understand how Fuchsia works.
