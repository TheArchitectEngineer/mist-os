## Timekeeping

The following updates have been made for Timekeeping:

* **Implemented the new `fuchsia.time.alarms` FIDL API for managing wake alarms,
  utilizing the hrtimer device as a backend.** This includes requesting hrtimer
  access, configuring conditional serving of the API for Starnix, and
  integrating it with the vim3 board. The wake alarm manager also received
  integration fixes, including `GetProperties()` and temporary `CancelSync()`
  FIDL APIs, and the `alarms` crate was factored out for better testing. Added
  tracing to the wake alarms service and resolved an issue with long sleep
  durations by implementing a resolution fix in the hrtimer driver. Also added
  details about `max_ticks` to hrtimer FIDL and corrected hrtimer configuration
  for broader platform support.
