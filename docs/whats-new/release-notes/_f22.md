## UI

The following updates have been made for UI:

* **SceneManager now uses the `fuchsia.power.SuspendEnabled` config capability
  to control the `suspend_enabled` configuration, enabling testing and gated use
  of the suspend feature.**
  * Changes: [fxr/1088434](https://fuchsia-review.googlesource.com/c/fuchsia/+/1088434),
    [fxr/1088495](https://fuchsia-review.googlesource.com/c/fuchsia/+/1088495)
* **Refined ActivityManager's integration with the power framework (flag-gated).
  Initial integration was reverted due to OOM issues, and subsequent changes
  re-introduced state transition management using `LeaseHolder` and
  `StateTransitioner` to prepare for proper wake lease integration. This work
  included updates to the `suspend_enabled` config, new integration tests, and
  routing of the `fuchsia.power.SuspendEnabled` capability.**
  * Changes: [fxr/1059173](https://fuchsia-review.googlesource.com/c/fuchsia/+/1059173),

    [fxr/1088613](https://fuchsia-review.googlesource.com/c/fuchsia/+/1088613)
* **Improved the handling of `InputDevice` and `InputFile`. `InputFile::read`
  now returns as many events as possible, and waiter notifications are more
  accurate due to the use of pending event counts. Button event debugging in
  Starnix has also been enhanced with inspect counting and additional
  logging.**
