*   **Improved A11yManager modularity** by making the `ColorConverter` protocol
    connection conditional on the `AttachA11yView` flag.
    *   Changes: [fxr/1207064](https://fuchsia-review.googlesource.com/c/fuchsia/+/1207064)

## Audio

The following updates have been made for Audio:

*   **Improved the Audio Device Registry (ADR)** to gracefully handle Composite
    device removals, preventing potential crashes. A new platform configuration
    flag has also been introduced to control the eager startup of the ADR
    service.
    *   Changes:
        [fxr/1261445](https://fuchsia-review.googlesource.com/c/fuchsia/+/1261445),

*   **Enhanced audio drivers** for improved stability and identification.
    AML-G12 drivers now expose `manufacturer` and `product` properties, use the
    SDK `platform-device` library, and no longer crash if `Stop` is called
    before `Start`. The `intel-hda` driver now correctly handles the creation of
    a second ring buffer.

    directly within the OpenThread netstack.
    *   Changes: [fxr/1259525](https://fuchsia-review.googlesource.com/c/fuchsia/+/1259525)

## Kernel

The following updates have been made for Kernel:

*   **Implemented the `ZX_VM_FAULT_BEYOND_STREAM_SIZE` flag** for `zx_vmar_map`.
    This allows memory access beyond a VMO's content size to fault, improving
    compatibility with POSIX `mmap` semantics.
*   **Added support for ktrace streaming.**  `zx_ktrace_read` now consumes the
    data it reads, enabling userspace to stream kernel trace data by invoking
    this syscall in a loop. As part of this cleanup, the unused
    `zx_ktrace_write` syscall was removed.

*   **Added support for mappable kernel clocks.** These clocks support efficient
    read access without entering the kernel in most circumstances. See [RFC
    0266](/docs/contribute/governance/rfcs/0266_memory_mappable_kernel_clocks.md)
    for details on the design.

## Netstack

The following updates have been made for Nestack:

*   **Netstack3 is planned to be enabled (via a feature flag) right after F27
    rolls out to 100% and before F28 starts rolling out.**
*   **Introduced comprehensive support for TCP Selective Acknowledgement
    (SACK)**, including SACK-based loss recovery and congestion control updates,
    to significantly improve TCP performance over lossy networks.
    *   Changes: [fxr/1242089](https://fuchsia-review.googlesource.com/c/fuchsia/+/1242089)
    *   Bugs: [fxb/42078221](https://fxbug.dev/42078221)
*   **Improved TCP ACK behavior** by enabling delayed ACKs by default,
    introducing quickack periods, and ensuring more accurate window update
    calculations for better performance.

*   **Enhanced TCP reliability and correctness** by fixing several critical
    bugs, including an arithmetic overflow in CUBIC, a panic on out-of-order
    SACKs, incorrect RTT/RTO calculations, and improper retransmission timer
    re-arming.

## Tools

The following updates have been made for Tools:

### fx

The following updates have been made for fx:

*   **Improved the `fx set` command for better build directory management.** It
    now defaults to `--auto-dir` to create product-specific build directories,
    with `out/default` becoming a convenient symlink. Several bugs have been
    fixed, including issues with the `--dir` and `--fint-params-path` flags, and
    the build directory is no longer stored in `fx.config`, preventing staleness
    issues.
    *   Changes:
        [fxr/1262444](https://fuchsia-review.googlesource.com/c/fuchsia/+/1262444),
        [fxr/1262024](https://fuchsia-review.googlesource.com/c/fuchsia/+/1262024),

        [fxr/1261405](https://fuchsia-review.googlesource.com/c/fuchsia/+/1261405),
        [fxr/1240890](https://fuchsia-review.googlesource.com/c/fuchsia/+/1240890)
*   **Standardized and improved target selection flags.** The `fx -d` flag is
    now deprecated in favor of `fx -t` or `fx --target` to align with `ffx`.
    *   Changes:
        [fxr/1252244](https://fuchsia-review.googlesource.com/c/fuchsia/+/1252244),
        [fxr/1214024](https://fuchsia-review.googlesource.com/c/fuchsia/+/1214024)
*   **Added a warning to the `fx build` command to warn developers against using
    Ninja target names instead of GN labels.** This change encourages proper
    build argument usage and helps prepare for future Bazel integration.
    *   Changes: [fxr/1233124](https://fuchsia-review.googlesource.com/c/fuchsia/+/1233124)
    *   Bugs: [fxb/42084668](https://fxbug.dev/42084668)
*   **Enhanced build analytics from `fx`** to report more context, such as
    whether a build was triggered by `fx test` or `fx multi`, and to include
    more build arguments from `args.json`.
    *   Changes:
        [fxr/1245197](https://fuchsia-review.googlesource.com/c/fuchsia/+/1245197),

### ffx

The following updates have been made for ffx:

*   **Removed the daemon-based package server from `ffx`.** All associated
    commands (`ffx repository add`, `list`, `remove`, `status`, etc.) are also
    removed. Users should now use the standalone `ffx repository server`
    commands.

        [fxb/393632047](https://fxbug.dev/393632047)
*   **Improved networking and connectivity.** `ffx` now correctly handles IPv6
    addresses with scope IDs, provides more useful error messages for connection
    failures, and more robustly discovers and manages targets, especially over
    USB/VSOCK. Support for Overnet over VSOCK has also been added.
    *   Changes:
        [fxr/1260729](https://fuchsia-review.googlesource.com/c/fuchsia/+/1260729),

        [fxr/1245565](https://fuchsia-review.googlesource.com/c/fuchsia/+/1245565)
*   **Added an opt-in Terminal User Interface (TUI)** for `ffx` and `fx`
    commands to provide enhanced formatting. This can be enabled via the
    `ffx.ui.mode` configuration. The `fx use` command is the first to adopt
    this.
    *   Changes: [fxr/1255350](https://fuchsia-review.googlesource.com/c/fuchsia/+/1255350)
*   **Updated `ffx product` and `ffx package` to be standalone executables,**
    which are no longer bundled into the main `ffx` binary. This change improves

        [fxr/1236071](https://fuchsia-review.googlesource.com/c/fuchsia/+/1236071)
*   **Improved flashing speed and reliability.** The `ffx flash` command is now
    significantly faster for large images due to an increased transfer buffer
    size. It can also now correctly handle large sparse images by automatically
    re-chunking them. A bug causing an "Unknown Ninja path" error in `fx flash`
    has also been fixed.

        [fxr/1238368](https://fuchsia-review.googlesource.com/c/fuchsia/+/1238368)
*   **Updated the `ffx trace` command to better visualize FIDL IPC traces.** It
    uses a two-pass approach to correctly render asynchronous two-way FIDL calls
    as single, continuous flows in Perfetto and sets event names to FIDL method
    names for easier debugging.
    *   Changes:
        [fxr/1232114](https://fuchsia-review.googlesource.com/c/fuchsia/+/1232114),
