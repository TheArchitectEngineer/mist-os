## Starnix

The following updates have been made for Starnix:

* **Implemented fscrypt ioctls, added support for encryption keys managed

  locking.
  * Changes: [fxr/1096181](https://fuchsia-review.googlesource.com/c/fuchsia/+/1096181)

  * Changes: [fxr/1139553](https://fuchsia-review.googlesource.com/c/fuchsia/+/1139553)
  * Bugs: [fxb/373898293](https://fxbug.dev/373898293)
* **Re-enabled Starnix suspend functionality is re-enabled.** Wake locks are
  tracked in the kernel, and container suspension is delegated to the runner,
  which monitors registered channels to resume the container. Related fixes

    [fxr/1152473](https://fuchsia-review.googlesource.com/c/fuchsia/+/1152473)
* **Fixed the `FIONBIO` ioctl and capabilities calculation during `execve`.**
  `FIONBIO` correctly handles the `NONBLOCK` flag based on user input, and
  capabilities for set-user-ID root programs are correctly calculated during
  `execve`. However, file capabilities and `SECBIT_NOROOT` are not yet
  addressed for the latter.
