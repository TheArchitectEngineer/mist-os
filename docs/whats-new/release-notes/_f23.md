    [fxr/1073686](https://fuchsia-review.googlesource.com/c/fuchsia/+/1073686)
  * Bugs: [fxb/42082459](https://fxbug.dev/42082459)
* **Improved the `ScopedGlobalLogger` implementation by simplifying it:**As it
  never actually makes any async calls, there is no need to create a thread for
  the logger.
  * Changes: [fxr/1109755](https://fuchsia-review.googlesource.com/c/fuchsia/+/1109755)
* **Simplified the forwarding mechanism in `driver_test_realm` by using
  `realm_builder_exposed_dir` to forward connections:** This fixes an issue
  with exposing the fuchsia.hardware.ramdisk service which wasn't using the
  forwarding mechanism, and also allows us to use `dtr_exposes` rather than the
  deprecated exposes Start argument.
  * Changes: [fxr/1098232](https://fuchsia-review.googlesource.com/c/fuchsia/+/1098232)

  protocols (along with their composing protocols).
  `fuchsia.component/ComponentController` is now open with flexible `OnEscrow`
  and `OnStopInfo` events.
  * Changes: [fxr/1105376](https://fuchsia-review.googlesource.com/c/fuchsia/+/1105376),

* **Updated the iperf benchmarks that run over loopback run against a hermetic
  netstack:** Existing tests were repurposed to run iperf using netemul sandbox
  and modified into benchmarks. The existing python script for running the
  iperf benchmarks was kept to reuse the logic for turning iperf JSON output
  to fuchsiaperf output.

    [fxr/1107892](https://fuchsia-review.googlesource.com/c/fuchsia/+/1107892)
* **Added support for bootloader Fat partitions and EFI product bundles.** This
  allows the emulator to launch from product bundles that only include
  bootloader partitions or contain EFI based kernels.
  * Changes: [fxr/1104347](https://fuchsia-review.googlesource.com/c/fuchsia/+/1104347),
    [fxr/1094270](https://fuchsia-review.googlesource.com/c/fuchsia/+/1094270)
* **Added FfxCoreSubCommand and check\_core\_constraints.** This function makes
  checks before command execution to ensure the command is invoked with the
  machine interface, has only one config flag passed, and the config flag passed
  is a path to a file. The target is also specified from the CLI. libfho will
  invoke this function on the subtool before execution.
  * Changes: [fxr/1109449](https://fuchsia-review.googlesource.com/c/fuchsia/+/1109449)
* **Added active\_channels to play command.** This adds a `--channels` flag to
  the `ffx audio device play` command. This flag manipulates which channels are

* **Improved error handling.** Several improvements were made to the error
  handling and reporting of ffx. This includes reporting SSH errors properly,
  improving the error message for port in use, and adding an error for incorrect
  build directories.
  * Changes: [fxr/1109339](https://fuchsia-review.googlesource.com/c/fuchsia/+/1109339),
  [fxr/1105292](https://fuchsia-review.googlesource.com/c/fuchsia/+/1105292),
  [fxr/1106412](https://fuchsia-review.googlesource.com/c/fuchsia/+/1106412)
* **Updated `ffx` to support direct connections with the `--core` flag.** This
  updates the ffx behavior for handling connections and providing FIDL protocols
  for developers. When passing the `--core` flag to a command, non-daemon
  behavior will be put to use where possible.
  * Changes: [fxr/1097107](https://fuchsia-review.googlesource.com/c/fuchsia/+/1097107)
* **Cleaned up old configuration generation code and added a new
  `--assembly-override` option to `fx set`.** This option sets the new developer
  assembly overrides mapping up correctly in `args.gn`.
  * Changes: [fxr/1104135](https://fuchsia-review.googlesource.com/c/fuchsia/+/1104135),
    [fxr/1098152](https://fuchsia-review.googlesource.com/c/fuchsia/+/1098152)

### fx

The following updates have been made for `fx`:

* **Updated `fx serve` to exclusively use the foreground repository server,
  simplifying its operation. `ffx` is now the default repository server, and
  related configurations have been updated. This also prepares for the removal
  of pm.**
  * Changes: [fxr/1100093](https://fuchsia-review.googlesource.com/c/fuchsia/+/1100093),

  * Bugs: [fxb/358451491](https://fxbug.dev/358451491)
* **Routing LogSink manually is not needed, as this is done implicitly through
  the client shard. Future CLs will update the routing used in the shard, so
  it's necessary to cleanup these duplicate routes in order to update the
  shards.**
  * Changes: [fxr/1097792](https://fuchsia-review.googlesource.com/c/fuchsia/+/1097792)

## WLAN

* **Added roaming functionality.** This feature allows WLAN to initiate roaming
  through the fullmac device firmware. Upon roam, the Policy roam monitor is
  now reinitialized to improve reliability.
  * Changes: [fxr/914513](https://fuchsia-review.googlesource.com/c/fuchsia/+/914513),
    [fxr/1110335](https://fuchsia-review.googlesource.com/c/fuchsia/+/1110335),

    [fxr/1092933](https://fuchsia-review.googlesource.com/c/fuchsia/+/1092933)
* **Improved WLAN logging.** `wlancfg` now captures a snapshot of the system
  state when it successfully recovers from WLAN issues. The
  `client-connections-toggle-events` node has been renamed, the log line now
  correctly states that the country code was received. The interface manager
  will log the state of all client and AP state machines before taking action
  during recovery. The `wlan_connectivity_states`, `connected_networks`,
  `disconnected_networks`, and `disconnect_sources` time series are now logged.
  * Changes: [fxr/1109979](https://fuchsia-review.googlesource.com/c/fuchsia/+/1109979),

  * Bugs: [fxb/357638987](https://fxbug.dev/357638987)
* **Fixed WLAN issues.** An issue has been fixed where a phy removal during
  iface removal could result in `wlandevicemonitor` keeping a stale iface. The
  `send_assoc_req_frame` function no longer has arguments. The
  `WlanFullmacImplIfc` FFI is no longer accessed after `stop_fullmac_mlme()`
  has been called.
