  in C++ and Rust FIDL bindings.** This includes type-safe support for monotonic
  and boot instants using `zx::basic_time` and `fuchsia_zircon` types, added
  conversion traits for `zx::basic_time` in C++ bindings, support for encoding
  and decoding `{Boot,Monotonic}Instant` and  `zx::basic_time` in Rust and
  C++ FIDL bindings, support for ticks in Rust bindings, and an increased buffer
  size for asynchronous receive in Rust FIDL.

  arrays recursively, adding a boolean in the FIDL build for vendor HLCPP
  visibility, renaming the new Rust FIDL bindings library to `fidl_next`,
  decoupling resources from the core FIDL Rust library, minimizing
  `not_needed()` statements and removing passing of the SDK category to
  `fidl_cpp_family()` in GN build, requiring the `"stable"` parameter in
  `fidl_library()`,  and adding missing tests to the FIDL bundle. Also addressed
