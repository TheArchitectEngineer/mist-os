    """Creates a binary driver which targets Fuchsia.

    Wraps a cc_shared_library rule and provides appropriate defaults.

    This method currently just simply ensures that libc++ is statically linked.
    In the future it will ensure drivers are correctly versioned and carry the
    appropriate package resources.

    If srcs are included the macro will create a cc_library and put all of the
    deps into that library. If srcs are not provided then the deps will be added
    directly to the cc_shared_library.

    Args:
        name: the target name
        srcs: (optional) the sources to include in the driver. If not provided,
          the user should provide a cc_library in the deps.

          will default to lib<name>.so
