# How the platform build manages IDKs and SDKs

This document describes how the Fuchsia IDKs and Bazel SDKs
are generated by the platform build, the role of each instance
and their relationships. This information is crucial for the
rest of the migration to Bazel, and will be updated accordingly.

## The GN-generated IDKs and Bazel SDKs

### The Fuchsia IDK

The GN `//sdk:final_fuchsia_idk` target is used to build [^1] and validate the
Fuchsia IDK (formerly known as the "core" or "partner" IDK), which is the
official archive distributed to third-party SDK developers. It contains all
atoms in the "partner" category, as well as prebuilt binaries for all
combinations of supported CPU architectures and API levels.

Currently, this is built directly from Ninja (no Bazel required)
as the shape of the Fuchsia IDK (i.e. which atoms it includes) it
entirely defined in the GN build graph (in [`//sdk/BUILD.gn`](/sdk/BUILD.gn)).

Note that building the Fuchsia IDK takes a long time [^2][^3] due to the high
number of `(cpu, api_level)` combinations that must be built. Thus, this target
is only built by a few dedicated builder configurations (e.g. `sdk-core-linux`).

[^1]: `//sdk:final_fuchsia_idk.exported` is the GN target for the IDK.
`//sdk:final_fuchsia_idk` wraps it along with its validation and archive
targets.

[^2]: Because these sub-builds are rarely built, the remote cache is rarely
helpful. As a result, each sub-build takes approximately 5 to 8 minutes. Due to
sub-build mechanics, the sub-builds cannot start until the contents of the IDK
have already been built once and thus start late in the build. Also, sub-build
parallelism is limited for performance reasons, so there will be effectively
multiple rounds of sub-builds.

[^3]: For local builds, the build time can be
significantly reduced by setting the `idk_buildable_cpus` and
`idk_buildable_api_levels` GN args.

### The Fuchsia Bazel SDK

The GN `//sdk:final_fuchsia_sdk` target is used to build (but not validate or
generate the archive) the official Fuchsia Bazel SDK distributed to third-party
developers. It augments the Fuchsia IDK with our set of Bazel-specific build
rules and target declarations.

Its content is directly usable by third-party Bazel projects, which
can include it with a simple `local_repository()` directive in their
`WORKSPACE.bazel` file, such as:

```
local_repository(
    name = "fuchsia_sdk",
    path = "/path/to/fuchsia_sdk",
)
```

Just like the Fuchsia IDK, the Fuchsia Bazel SDK is
built directly from GN, without using any Bazel workspace, and
building it takes so long that this is only done on a few dedicated
builder configurations (e.g. `sdk-bazel-linux`).

### The In-Tree IDK

The GN `//sdk:bazel_in_tree_idk` target is used to build an IDK (actually an IDK
collection) that has the same set of atoms as the Fuchsia IDK, but which only
provides prebuilt binaries for the current `target_cpu` architecture,
and the `HEAD` API level (using artifacts from the main `PLATFORM` build).
It is only intended to be used to populate the `@fuchsia_sdk` and
`@fuchsia_in_tree_idk` repositories (described below).

### The In-Tree Internal IDK

The GN `//sdk:bazel_internal_only_idk` target groups atoms with
an unstable API and that are not ready to be moved to the "partner"
category. This should only be used to populate the `@internal_sdk`
repository of the in-tree Bazel workspace. These atoms should
never be used outside of the platform build.

It only contains prebuilt binaries for the current `target_cpu`
architecture, and the `HEAD` API level (also from the `PLATFORM` build)).

Nothing in the GN graph should depend on this.

### IDK and SDK subsets
As previously mentioned, building the Fuchsia IDK and Fuchsia Bazel SDK can take
a long time. As a mitigation for platform developers working with these targets
or needing to locally build an SDK to test with a specific target, there are a
small number of GN targets that generate the IDK or SDK with support for
targeting a subset of API levels and/or CPU architectures. These can be used
like the publishable IDK and SDK, respectively.

The following subsets are currently supported:
* API level `HEAD` and default target CPU architecture:
  * `//sdk:final_fuchsia_idk_head_only`
  * `//sdk:final_fuchsia_sdk_head_only`

## The Bazel external repositories

The platform build's internal Bazel workspace also uses a number
of [external](https://bazel.build/external/overview)
[repositories](https://bazel.build/concepts/build-ref#repositories)
that are related to the IDK and the Bazel SDK:

### The `@fuchsia_in_tree_idk` repository:

This repository currently wraps the Ninja-generated in-tree IDK
as a Bazel repository. A key difference though is that its
metadata files contain Bazel target labels, instead of file
paths, for any buildable artifacts (i.e. not source files),
for example, `pkg/fdio/meta.json` looks like:

```
{
  "binaries": {
    "x64": {
      "debug": "@fuchsia_in_tree_idk//.build-id:15/646fc64e58e6bc964d5781afec10233689ab08.debug",
      "dist": "@fuchsia_in_tree_idk//arch/x64:dist/libfdio.so",
      "dist_path": "lib/libfdio.so",                            # <-- configuration string
      "link": "@fuchsia_in_tree_idk//arch/x64:lib/libfdio.so"   # <-- ninja artifact
    }
  },
  "deps": [],
  "format": "shared",
  "headers": [
    "pkg/fdio/include/lib/fdio/directory.h",   # <-- symlink to source file
    "pkg/fdio/include/lib/fdio/fd.h",          # <-- symlink to source file
    ...
  ],
  "ifs": "fdio.ifs",
  "include_dir": "pkg/fdio/include",
  "name": "fdio",
  "root": "pkg/fdio",
  "type": "cc_prebuilt_library"
}
```

In the current implementation, the labels point to simple
symlinks that go into the Ninja build directory. But this
extra level of indirection will allow, in the future, building
said artifacts directly with Bazel.

Note that this does *not* comply with the official IDK layout,
so its content cannot be used or distributed outside of the platform
build's Bazel workspace.

### The `@fuchsia_sdk` repository:

This repository exposes the same set of atoms and binaries as
the in-tree IDK, augmented with Bazel SDK rule definitions and
Bazel targets for each atom.

It is used by the `BUILD.bazel` files inside of `fuchsia.git`, to
use SDK atom targets and our set of Bazel rules to develop Fuchsia
packages with them.

It is populated by parsing the content of the `@fuchsia_in_tree_idk`
repository.

Note that its content cannot be used directly in external Bazel
workspaces.

### The `@fuchsia_internal_only_idk` repository:

This is similar to `@fuchsia_in_tree_idk`, but wraps the content of
the `//sdk:bazel_internal_only_idk` instead.

### The `@internal_sdk` repository:

This repository exposes SDK atoms and binaries from the in-tree
internal IDK to the platform build's Bazel workspace. This means
that only prebuilts for the current `target_cpu` architecture and
 `HEAD` API  levels are available there.

It is populated by parsing the content of the
`@fuchsia_internal_only_idk` repository.

# Existing dependencies

The following diagram illustrates the dependencies between the items
described above. The notation `[foo()]` denotes a repository rule
invocation, which occurs when Bazel sets up external repositories,
while `[[bar()]]` denotes a regular build rule invoked through an
explcitit `bazel build` command.

                                                     |
```

## The `fuchsia_idk_repository()` function

This function takes an IDK as input, and populates a Bazel repository,
with it, changing the content of its metadata files to include Bazel
targets for buildable artifacts, plus adding the necessary `BUILD.bazel`
files that they reference.

Note that the output repository's content does not follow the
official IDK layout anymore, and should never be used outside of
the platform build's Bazel workspace.

## The `fuchsia_sdk_repository()` function

This function takes an IDK as input, and generates a Bazel SDK
directory or repository as output.

Its logic is written in a special way to allow it to run either in
a Starlark environment (i.e. as a Bazel repository rule), or in a
Python one (i.e. as a build action, either from Ninja or Bazel).

Currently, it is used as Python at build time to generate the Fuchsia Bazel SDK
from the Fuchsia IDK, as a Ninja action, and the final Fuchsia in-tree
SDK, as a Bazel action.

It is also used as Starlark in the Bazel repository rules that generate
the `@fuchsia_sdk` and `@internal_sdk` repositories.
