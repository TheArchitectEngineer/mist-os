This directory contains enough of the Fuchsia source directory to support
`generate_prebuild_idk.py`. It also contains an output directory that allows
relative access to source files (e.g., `version_history.json`) and contains
files generated by GN gen that are needed by atoms in `test_collection.json`.

The symbolic links in `third_party/` are needed by atoms (e.g., `sl4f`) in
`test_collection.json`.
