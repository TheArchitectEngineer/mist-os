    """Generate the tests.json file.

    tests.json is created by merging two things:

    1) tests_from_metadata.json
       A collection of test specs found from a GN metadata walk. These test
       specs are copied without modification into the final tests.json.

    2) product_bundle_test_groups.json
       A file that declares a mapping of product bundle name to a specific set
       of tests found in another tests.json. These test specs will be modified
       to include `product_bundle: <name>` before merging it into the final
       tests.json.

    Args:
        build_dir: Fuchsia build directory.

    Returns:
        A set of Path values for the input files read by this function.
