      This creates the following directory structure under the destination outdir:

              <package name>

    Files matching the patterns `packages/*/<package name>` and
    `subpackages/<merkle>` are JSON representations of the
    `PackageManifest` type (see `package_manifest.py`). (The `<merkle>` in
    `subpackages/` is the merkle of the subpackage's metafar.) A named package
    that is also referenced as a subpackage will have a copy of its manifest in
    both directories. (This is an intentional duplication to allow the
    simplification of the creation and use of the AIBs.)

    Each `PackageManifest` contains a `blobs` list of `BlobEntry` and an
    optional `subpackages` list of `SubpackageEntry`. The `source_path` of a
    `BlobEntry` references a file containing the blob bytes, in the `blobs/`
    directory. The `manifest_path` of a `SubpackageEntry` references another
    `PackageManifest` file in `subpackages/<merkle>`.
