# Allow anyone to approve manifest changes. The dependencies pinned in manifests
# in this directory have a wide array of owners, and the manifest schema is
# simple enough to be self-service.
#
# It's also important that any service accounts used by rollers that update
# pinned dependencies be included as owners of this directory. "*" implicitly
# also grants ownership to service accounts.
