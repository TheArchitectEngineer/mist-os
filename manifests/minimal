  <!--
  A minimal checkout including only fuchsia.git itself.

  This manifest is intended to be used by rollers that need to update
  fuchsia.git. It uses a shallow clone of fuchsia.git to avoid downloading
  history that's not needed for a simple roll CL.

  This duplicates the fuchsia.git manifest entry in the `platform` manifest
  because that one has a `githooks` entry pointing into //integration, but we
  want to be able to check out fuchsia without integration.
