Description:
This is a C++ header-only library to provide an IEEE 754 conformant 16-bit half-precision
floating-point type along with corresponding arithmetic operators, type conversions and common
mathematical functions. It aims for both efficiency and ease of use, trying to accurately mimic the
behaviour of the built-in floating-point types at the best performance possible.

This directory has the Fuchsia build integration.  The src/ subdirectory contains the actual source
from the upstream repository. Because the upstream is SVN, the src/ subdirectory is manually updated
from the upstream rather than using git rolls.
