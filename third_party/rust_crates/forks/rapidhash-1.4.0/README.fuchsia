Description: Port of rapidhash: a fast and high quality hashing algorithm.

* What is this crate used for?
Stable and fast non-cryptographic hashing.

* Are there any use restrictions? i.e. only for development hosts
No.

* What differs from upstream? Include a changelog if feasible.
Removal of benches/quality.rs (see https://fxbug.dev/430651972).

* Are there any restrictions to how it should be rolled?
Use caution when rolling major versions, which may cause hash outputs to
change. Hash values *must* remain stable across versions. The upstream
crate guarantees hash stability across minor version rolls and patches.

No.
