Description:

* What are these crates used for?

These are Bluetooth utility crates which implement various parts of the Bluetooth Specifications,
currently Low Energy Audio Profiles.  See more info in README.md.

They are developed mainly at bluetooth.googlesource.com and mirrored here to update them at the
same time as Bluetooth components in the fuchsia.git tree.

* Are there any use restrictions? i.e. only for development hosts

No

* What differs from upstream? Include a changelog if feasible.

Only the rust/ subdirectory of upstream has been included.
LICENSE files which were symlinks to outside the rust/ subdirectory have been copied from the
source file.

Cargo.toml files have been updated to un-duplicate lines that depend on the workspace:
i.e. something.workspace = true => something = "1.2.3"
due to an issue with rules_rust not finding the workspace Cargo.toml and failing
fx update-rustc-third-party


The mirror should be updated using the new script, update_bluetooth.sh, included here, by
specifying a git upstream hash.
i.e.: ./update_bluetooth.sh c88c57d26787871904541c1beb7881f6e4b18b66

* Are there any restrictions to how it should be rolled?

No.

* Is there anything else which makes this dependency "special"?

No.
