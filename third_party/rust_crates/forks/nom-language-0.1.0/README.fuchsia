Name: nom
License File: LICENSE
Description:

nom-language is used in both host and target side for parsing.

This is nom-language mainline (0.1.0)  with a minimal change: the inclusion of
LICENSE file. The `nom-language` crate shares the same license as `nom` and are
located in the same git repository. However, v0.1.0 missed including a LICENSE
file in the crate package. We've contribtued the license file:
https://github.com/rust-bakery/nom/pull/1816 but are waiting for a release that
includes it.

The only files modified file is the inclusion of the LICENSE file as a copy of
nom license.

This fork can be removed when:

* nom-language releases a package that includes the LICENSE file.
