// Rules for Timers:
// - Timer callbacks occur from interrupt context.
// - Timers may be programmed or canceled from interrupt or thread context.
// - Timers may be canceled or reprogrammed from within their callback.
// - Setting and canceling timers is not thread safe and cannot be done concurrently.
// - Timer::cancel() may spin waiting for a pending timer to complete on another cpu.
// - Timers aren't permanently bound to a particular CPU and may fire on a CPU other
//   than the one on which they were set.

// Timers may be removed from an arbitrary TimerQueue, so their list
// node requires the AllowRemoveFromContainer option.
