/*
 * MSR Benchmark:
 *
 * This benchmark attempts to measure the cost of reading and writing MSR
 * registers (specifically, the TSC Deadline register used to implement timers
 * on x64), and the effect that doing so might have on other CPUs' performance.
 *
 * These measurements are meant to serve two purposes:
 *
 * 1) To compare the relative performance of MSR reads/writes across
 * 1a) Native HW environments (eg; running on a 'host');
 * 1b) Guest VM environments running directly inside of a host.
 * 1b) Nested guest VM environments (eg; a guest inside of a guest inside of a
 *     host)
 * 2) To see if reading/writing MSR registers on one CPU has an affect on other
 *    CPUs.
 *
 * #1 helps us to understand the cost of MSR access in a VM environment, while
 * #2 helps us to understand if a VM environments implementation of MSR access
 * affects other CPUs.  We expected that it would not, but VMs can be tricky
 * (esp. nested VMs).
 *
 * The structure of the benchmark is as follows:
 *
 * We will take measurements across a number of stages across all currently
 * online CPUs.  One of the online CPUs is considered to be the "primary" CPU,
 * while the others are considered to be "secondaries".  Each stage has two
 * "actions" it will perform, one for the primary CPU, and another for the
 * secondaries.  During the measurement for a stage, each CPU will disable
 * interrupts, and then see how many times they can complete their assigned
 * action within a fixed measurement interval.
 *
 * During the first stage, all of the CPU actions will consist of simple
 * arithmetic in order to establish a baseline.  Subsequent stages will consist
 * of the tests of MSR register reads and writes, split into two phases.  In the
 * first phase the primary CPU will perform MSR reads/writes, while the
 * secondaries run the arithmetic action.  In the second phase, all of the CPUs
 * will perform the MSR read/writes performed by the primary CPU in the first
 * phase.
 *
 * After taking measurements for each stage the test threads shut down and the
 * results are printed.  If MSR reads/writes are not having an affect on other
 * CPUs, we expect to see the arithmetic numbers for secondaries to be basically
 * unchanged from the baseline established in the first stage when the primary
 * CPU is performing MSR accesses.  Likewise, if MSR accesses have no affect on
 * other CPUs, we expect all CPUs to show the same MSR performance when running
 * concurrently as the primary CPU did when it was the only CPU performing MSR
 * accesses.
 *
 * The console thread is used to sequence the benchmarks, but is not actually
 * responsible for taking any measurements.  It creates one thread per-active
 * CPU, each of which run with default weight and has hard affinity for one of
 * the currently active CPUs.  Each of these threads will
 * spin-sleep until the console thread tells them to start the next measurement
 * stage.
 *
 * At that point in time, all of the threads become more aggressive in their
 * spinning behavior.  Once realizing that the stage has started, each CPU
 * disables interrupts, and then each secondary CPU signals to the primary that
 * they are ready to start before spin-waiting on the signal from the primary
 * CPU to start.
 *
 * The primary spin-waits for the secondaries to become ready, then assigns a
 * deadline for the stage, finally signals to everyone that the measurement is
 * ready to start.  Each thread:
 * 1) Counts the number of times they are able to make it through their stage's
 *    measurement action before the deadline.
 * 2) Records the result.
 * 3) Signals to the console thread that they are finished.
 * 4) Re-enables interrupts.
 * 5) And finally waits for the console thread to tell them to start the next
 *    stage.
 *
 * Once all of the measurements have been taken, the measurement threads exit,
 * the console thread prints the results, and finally cleans up all of the test
 * resources.
