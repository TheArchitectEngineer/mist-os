# Public headers for the Fuchsia C library

The C library provides a suite of public header files.  These are the files
found by `#include <something.h>` for the various `<something.h>` APIs required
by the C standard or by other standard or traditional system C library APIs,
plus some Fuchsia-specific (Zircon) extensions.

The current implementation provides not only standard C library APIs but also a
subset of POSIX plus some BSD and GNU extensions and some Linux-specific APIs.
In the future, the distinctions between standard C and other APIs will be made
more formal, and some of these things will move elsewhere.  The set of Zircon
extensions and their precise API details are also subject to change.

This directory drives the build logic for all of the public C library headers.
Only some of those headers are maintained directly in this directory.  These
and the other kinds of headers handled here are described below.

## Sources of header files

### Zircon extensions

The Fuchsia C library provides a handful of new APIs that are idiosyncratic to
Fuchsia and mesh with the Zircon system call APIs.  All of these are declared
in `<zircon/*.h>` header files.  Those are maintained [right here](zircon).

### musl headers

The Fuchsia C library began as a fork of [musl](https://musl.libc.org/).  A
great deal of implementation code, and most of the public header files, are
still those inherited from musl (and much modified).  These are maintained
within this repository as the sole source of truth (without reference to
upstream musl, which has long since diverged from Fuchsia's fork).  They are
found in a [separate directory](/zircon/third_party/ulib/musl/include) to
reflect their lineage.

### llvm-libc headers

The future of the Fuchsia C library lies with the
[llvm-libc](https://libc.llvm.org/) project.  The LLVM C Library is not an
alternative to the Fuchsia C library.  It's one of the building blocks.  The
Fuchsia C library is steadily migrating to using both implementation code and
public header files from llvm-libc where possible.  This will eventually
replace everything inherited from musl, though much Fuchsia-specific
implementation detail (and the Zircon extension APIs) will continue to be
maintained in this repository and not in LLVM.

For code and header files from llvm-libc, the ultimate source of truth is in
the upstream [LLVM repository](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project).  The
[`libc`](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/main/libc) subdirectory of
that is [mirrored by Google](https://llvm.googlesource.com/llvm-project/libc/).
[Fuchsia `integration`](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/integration) places
that mirror at [`//third_party/llvm-libc/src`](/third_party/llvm-libc/src) in a
Fuchsia checkout.  The [build rules here](../libc.gni) refer to that code.  An
automated "roller" job attempts to update the pinned revision whenever the
mirror repository's `main` branch is updated (the mirror usually updates within
a few minutes of upstream LLVM repository changes).  This uses a normal Gerrit
change that must pass all automated build and test steps across many Fuchsia
builders before the update lands.

The llvm-libc [`include`](/third_party/llvm-libc/src/include) subdirectory
contains the public header files.  Some of these are used as public headers by
the Fuchsia C library.

#### Generated llvm-libc headers

The llvm-libc public header files comprise two categories:
 * Hand-maintained files of types and macros.
 * Generated files of function declarations.

Most of the hand-maintained files are "private" implementation headers in the
`llvm-libc-macros` and `llvm-libc-types` subdirectories of [llvm-libc's
`include`](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/main/libc/include).  These
files are "public" in the sense that they are installed and visible to users.
But they are "private" in the sense that their names and details are not part
of the public API; instead they are included transitively by the truly public
API headers as part of how they implement the public API declarations.

Most of the public API headers do not exist directly as `.h` files in
[`include`](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/main/libc/include).
Instead, they are generated by a build tool implemented in Python,
[`hdrgen`](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/main/libc/utils/hdrgen).
For each generated `.h` file there is a corresponding `.yaml` file in
[`include`](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/main/libc/include).
These files are not installed themselves, but they are the source of truth for
what goes into the public API headers.  The [llvm-libc developers'
documentation](https://libc.llvm.org/dev/header_generation.html) says more.

## Uses of header files

In "end-user" scenarios, the C library header files are always found implicitly
by the compiler without `-I` switches or build system plumbing about it.
Moreover, the compiler comes with header files of its own and is part of a
toolchain providing other libraries such as [libc++](https://libcxx.llvm.org/).
These toolchain-supplied header files can have some arcane interactions with C
library header files.  Normally, the compiler will first see header files from
the user's own build (via `-I` switches supplied through the build system);
then the toolchain's own header files; then the C library's header files.  If
instead the order is changed so that the C library's header files take
precedence over the toolchain-supplied header files, things go wrong.

### sysroot

The compiler and linker can take a `--sysroot=...` switch.  The directory this
points to is often called "the sysroot".  This is the root directory in which
header files and libraries will be found by default search paths.  When no
switch is provided, the compiler may be configured with a default sysroot
directory or may have default behavior that's roughly similar to `--sysroot=/`.
(In a traditional self-hosted Unix-style situation, that finds `/usr/include`,
`/usr/lib`, etc.)  The compiler's defaults for include paths, library paths,
and link inputs (such as the C library itself) are all relative to the sysroot
(except for those supplied by the toolchain itself, which are always relative
to the compiler's own location).

For most users, this is how both header files and link-time artifacts for the C
library (and perhaps other "system" libraries) are usually found.  To do
anything else requires special build plumbing and a potentially complex array
of compiler switches.  However, this usual way of things cannot apply to
building the C library itself, or anything else that goes into the sysroot,
without creating a circular dependency.

### Fuchsia SDK

The [Fuchsia SDK](/docs/development/sdk) includes the C library's headers along
with prebuilt binary artifacts for linking against the C library; for
redistributing the shared library binaries in Fuchsia packages; and for
debugging those binaries.  These headers and link-time artifacts are included
in a [sysroot](#sysroot) that is the foundation of public C and C++ APIs (and
public ABIs across languages) for Fuchsia SDK users.  As such, there are strict
controls on changes to the API and ABI surfaces defined by these header files
(as for the rest of the SDK).

In particular, every change to a header file in the sysroot (or any other
public header file in the SDK) requires an update to a `.api` file and must go
through [API review](/docs/contribute/governance/api_council.md#api-review).
This **cannot be fully automated, as a matter of prudently rigid policy**:
human intervention by an API reviewer is always required to provide approval
before a change can land.

### Fuchsia platform GN build

The Fuchsia GN build does not use the Fuchsia SDK per se.  Rather, it builds
many of the binary artifacts and assembles many of the source and header files
that will go into the SDK.  Among these, it builds the [sysroot](#sysroot) to
go into the SDK.  This contains copies of all the public header files for the C
library.

This sysroot is used to compile most Fuchsia userland code in the GN build.
It's automatically updated before it's used, so it automatically gets any
changes made to the header files maintained here in this repository and its
submodules (such as [llvm-libc](/third_party/llvm-libc/src)) in the local
checkout.  When this happens, those changes cannot land without necessary API
review procedures.

#### sysroot.api

For the C library, [`sysroot.api`](/zircon/public/sysroot_sdk/sysroot.api) is
the file that must be updated.  This will usually happen incidentally in a
build.  But it can always be checked explicitly with:

```shell
fx build //zircon/public/sysroot_sdk
```

This will fail for any changes by default.  To update it in the source tree,
set [`update_goldens = true`](/docs/gen/build_arguments.md#update_goldens) in
`args.gn` first.

The updated `.api` file must be included in the same commit that touches the
header files in the source tree.  Gerrit will not allow the change to land
without [API review](/docs/contribute/governance/api_council.md#api-review).
(Changing any `.api` file will trigger the API review requirement in Gerrit;
failing to change it will make the CQ bots fail.)

#### No automatic API review

As mentioned earlier, [llvm-libc](/third_party/llvm-libc/src) is usually
updated to a new revision in Fuchsia integration by an automatic "roller" job.
No integration change can land that invalidates any `.api` file in the Fuchsia
repository.  Manual approval is required--but that's in the Fuchsia repository.
Commits to the Fuchsia repository are usually independent of integration
commits and vice versa.  Hence, an upstream change will break the roller if it
would cause a change to the sysroot.  This problem is addressed below.

### Building libc

When building the C library itself, no sysroot is used.  Instead, the header
files are used directly from [the source tree](#sources-of-header-files).  This
ensures that the header files always correspond to the code being compiled.
For the public C library headers that come from llvm-libc, this means they come
directly from [`//third_party/llvm-libc/src`](/third_party/llvm-libc/src).

The [generated headers from llvm-libc](#generated-llvm-libc-headers) are
emitted by the build into the `gen/third_party/llvm-libc/src/include`
subdirectory of the build directory.  This directory is used along with the
`include` source directory when building libc.

### Hermetic partial libc for special environments

A few parts of the C library code are used in the kernel, the dynamic linker,
and other special environments.  These are not like most Fuchsia userland code,
and do not use the sysroot.  A subset of the C library code is compiled
separately in these special environments (via other GN toolchains).  (Compiling
the C library itself is really just another one of these special environments.)
All these cases use the headers directly from the source tree in the same way.

### Building llvm-libc unit tests

Most C library code is built a second time for testing purposes.  This version
is used with the [llvm-libc unit tests](/third_party/llvm-libc/src/test).
Unlike when the same code is built for the C library itself or in other special
environments, this is largely treated as normal Fuchsia userland code.  It uses
the default GN toolchain used for the rest of the platform GN build, and thus
uses that same sysroot.  However, this code also uses the public C library
headers directly from the source tree instead of those in the sysroot.

The files in the source tree should preempt the sysroot copies in most cases,
though there are some arcane cases in which the sysroot headers could still be
used.  The rationale is that the library and test code should get the headers
that match, even when Fuchsia userland code generally is still getting a
different version.  During soft transitions, the source tree and the sysroot
may diverge in the contents of some header files.  If this causes problems,
temporary workarounds may be needed to to get through a particular transition.
(It may be sufficient and expedient to temporarily disable big chunks of test
code during a short transition period.)

## The conundrum of the llvm-libc roller vs API review

Two competing principles are particularly relevant to the Fuchsia C library:
 1. Automation is essential to effective software development.
 2. Careful human review is essential to effective API maintenance.

The first is exemplified by the auto-roller from the LLVM repository.  The
second is exemplified by the strict API review requirement for all changes to
public header files.  The compromise between these two is reached by
_semi-automated copying_ and _soft transitions_.

### llvm-libc-golden

The [`llvm-libc-golden`](llvm-libc-golden) subdirectory contains all the header
files from llvm-libc that will be copied into [the sysroot](#sysroot) by the
[Fuchsia platform GN build](#fuchsia-platform-gn-build).  These in turn are
_copied_ from [the llvm-libc sources](/third_party/llvm-libc/src), but **not
entirely automatically**.

Ordinarily, a Fuchsia build will simply check that all the files in
[`llvm-libc-golden`](llvm-libc-golden) are already up to date: the build will
fail if any header file's source of truth in the checkout's revision of
llvm-libc has changed.  This checking is implemented using the same ["golden
files" mechanism](/build/testing/golden_files.gni) used for the `.api` files in
the source tree.  The `llvm-libc-golden` subdirectory of the local checkout can
be updated using the same [procedure described above](#sysroot_api).

**NOTE:** This means that any upstream header change will cause the auto-roller
to start failing.  Any such change will require a _soft transition_.

The [generated headers](#generated-llvm-libc-headers) are regenerated by the
build as needed and then also compared to `llvm-libc-golden` files (or copied
there when updating the golden files).

#### Soft transition procedure

When public header files taken from llvm-libc have changed upstream, the
llvm-libc auto-roller will fail until a _soft transition_ is completed.  A
_soft_ transition is a sequence of commits that can each land separately via
the CQ and pass all the normal automated checks, so no developer or bot build
is broken in the intermediate states.  All the changes in the sequence must
land in the correct order, but unrelated changes can safely land between them.

The soft transition for an llvm-libc header change will have these steps:
 1. Temporarily disable checking [`llvm-libc-golden`](llvm-libc-golden).
 2. Complete the llvm-libc "roll": update the pinned revision.
 3. Update [`llvm-libc-golden`](llvm-libc-golden) and resume checking.

To start any soft transition, first make sure there is a bug filed specifically
to track the whole sequence of steps.  This bug won't be closed until the
entire soft transition sequence is complete, but every commit in the sequence
will be tagged with the same bug number.  (If there is already a tracking bug
for the specific libc changes of which these upstream header changes are a
known component, then it can be reused even if it's not going to be marked
closed immediately upon completion of the header soft transition per se.  If
instead there is a generic "llvm-libc auto-roller is broken for some reason"
bug that turns out to just be the need for a header-change soft transition,
then it can be reused.)  We'll use `https://fxbug.dev/nnn` to refer to that
bug's canonical (short) URL.

The precise details for each step are:

 * Disable checking.
   1. Edit [this `BUILD.gn` file](BUILD.gn) to find the line that reads:
      ```gn
      llvm_libc_soft_transition = false
      ```
   2. Change this line to:
      ```gn
      llvm_libc_soft_transition = true # TODO(https://fxbug.dev/nnn)
      ```
   3. Land this change as a normal commit through Gerrit.
      Be sure to use `Bug: nnn` in the commit log.  For example:
      ```
      [libc] Start soft transition for llvm-libc header changes

      Bug: nnn
      Change-Id: ...
      ```
 * Complete the roll with a Gerrit integration commit.  This can be done
   manually through Gerrit, but it's best to leave it to the auto-roller job.
   1. Manually trigger it through the LUCI web UI (requires ACL privileges)
   2. A new upstream LLVM commit in the `libc` subdirectory will trigger it.
   3. Just wait a few hours, and it will try a job with the latest llvm-libc
      revision even if there haven't been more commits since the last (failed)
      roll attempt.
 * Update goldens and resume checking.
   1. Put `update_goldens = true` the `args.gn` of your local build.
   2. Reverse the edit to [this `BUILD.gn` file](BUILD.gn), so it reads:
      ```gn
      llvm_libc_soft_transition = false
      ```
   3. Update your local build, with whatever you usually do, or:
      ```shell
      fx build //zircon/public/sysroot_sdk
      ```
      This should modify the `llvm-libc-golden` files in the source tree,
      and perhaps also the `llvm-libc-generated.json` file.
      **Note:** It may be necessary to run this build at least twice to pick
      up all kinds of changes; to be safe, repeat until `nothing to do`.
      **Note:** If files are removed upstream, this should `git rm -f`
      the corresponding `llvm-libc-golden` files, but it won't in all
      cases `git add` new files that were used before.  It's a good idea to do:
      ```shell
      git add zircon/system/ulib/c/include/llvm-libc-generated
      ```
      That should be fine to do whether there are new files or not, and
      ensures that your next `git commit` will include everything new.
   4. Land this change as a normal commit through Gerrit.
      Be sure to use `Fixed: nnn` in the commit log.  For example:
      ```
      [libc] Complete soft transition for llvm-libc header changes

      Fixed: nnn
      Change-Id: ...
      ```

#### Mid-transition state

After the first two steps of the soft transition procedure, there will be
differences between the header files in the llvm-libc "source of truth" that's
used to compile the C library, its tests, etc.; and those in the sysroot, as
copied from [`llvm-libc-golden`](llvm-libc-golden).

In this state, there could be arcane unexpected effects of ABI drift between
callers compiled with older headers and callees compiled with newer headers.
If any such issues prevent landing either the llvm-libc roll step or the
golden-updates completion step, then ad hoc workarounds may be required.

However, some such issues could affect downstream SDK users not directly tested
in Fuchsia CQ/CI or not noticed very quickly.  It's important to minimize the
window of time and unrelated Fuchsia commits where `llvm_libc_soft_transition`
remains set to `true`.  Ideally no Fuchsia SDK built during that window would
be used by anything outside the Fuchsia build.

**Make absolutely sure that no new release branch is cut from a mid-transition
state of the Fuchsia repository!**

#### Adding or removing llvm-libc header files

Currently all the end-user API headers taken from llvm-libc are generated.  The
`llvm_libc_generated_headers` list in [`BUILD.gn`](BUILD.gn) is the source of
truth about which headers to generate from the llvm-libc sources.  Edit that
list to add or remove a generated header.  Any hand-written headers that are
included transitively should be picked up automatically.

The soft transition procedure above not only updates the `llvm-libc-golden`
files but also [`llvm-libc-generated.json`](llvm-libc-generated.json).  The
JSON file is used by the `gn gen` phase of the build code; this is implemented
in [`libc_headers.gni`](libc_headers.gni).  It lists each generated llvm-libc
header file, along with the list of hand-written files that it uses, to inform
the build machinery which files to maintain in the `llvm-libc-golden` directory
and ultimately to install for users.  This file itself is generated from the
llvm-libc sources and its `hdrgen` tool, and the `llvm_libc_generated_headers`
list in [`BUILD.gn`](BUILD.gn).  With `update_goldens = true`, the build will
update the JSON file in the source tree (without, the build will fail if the
JSON file needs to be updated due to a change in `BUILD.gn` or in llvm-libc).
Updating the JSON file may have changed what `llvm-libc-golden` files the build
knows about, so the next incremental build should finish the job; a third build
is prudent just to double-check that no more golden files are left to update.

Once everything is right in the local checkout, make sure that `git` is up to
date with the new or removed files in `llvm-libc-golden` before creating your
Gerrit change.  The checking / update script with `update_goldens = true` will
try to handle this for you by running some `git rm` and `git add` commands.
But that won't catch all cases.  It should always be safe and sufficient to do:
```shell
git add -A zircon/system/ulib/c/include/llvm-libc-golden
```
