/// This class provides a view into a buffer that implements a lockless multi-writer single reader
/// specialized for trace-engine.
///
/// Several design choices made here were done so to maintain compatibility with the previous
/// algorithm and current apis exposed by trace-engine. As such, this buffer may not be an ideal
/// abstraction for other use cases. Such decisions include:
///
/// - Not providing a means to commit writes: the caller must externally manage writes in flights to
///   correctly read and service the buffers.
/// - Double buffering rather than concurrent reads/writes.
/// - Exposing buffer swap functionality to the caller. Writers are responsible for ensuring that
///   buffers are correctly serviced when notified.
///
/// See the file comments in //zircon/system/ulib/trace-engine/rolling_buffer.cc for details on
/// operation. See //zircon/system/ulib/trace-engine/test/rolling_buffer_test.cc for examples on
/// usage.
