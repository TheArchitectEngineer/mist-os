# This file is used to build the sysroot directories used to build C++,
# Rust and Go binaries with the Fuchsia build system.
#
# A "sysroot" is a directory that should provide system headers, libraries
# and support files for a given target system. In the case of Fuchsia,
# its layout will look like:
#
#   * `include/`
#     - Files here are found via `#include <...>`.
#
#   * `lib/`
#     - `Scrt1.o` is found here by the compiler driver for an executable linked
#        without `-nostartfiles`.  This has nontrivial build steps that must
#        be done before linking any such executable.
#     - `lib*.so` files here are found at link time via `-l...` (including
#       implicitly by the compiler driver) and equivalent linker mechanisms
#       such as deplibs (which is used by some toolchain-supplied prebuilt
#       runtime libraries).  These files may be needed either explicitly or
#       implicitly to link shared_library() and loadable_module() targets as
#       well as executable() targets.  These files are all either tiny
#       generated_file() text files or ELF linking stubs made by very quick
#       ifs_shared_library() build steps.
#
# Note that in Fuchsia the sysroot **does not** contain the runtime files for
# shared libraries.  The sysroot only supplies compile-time and link-time
# files.  However, there are implied runtime file dependencies for any shared
# libraries used by executable() or loadable_module() targets; and for the
# PT_INTERP file of any dynamically-linked executable even if it uses no shared
# libraries per se.  None of these runtime files is needed at compile time, nor
# at link time.  But they must go into the Fuchsia package's filesystem image
# along with that executable, by being in data_deps and propagating metadata.
# The :data target handles this.
#
# Each sysroot is toolchain-specific to allow variants to affect its link-time
# artifacts (currently only `Scrt1.o` might differ, except by $current_cpu).
#
# Each sysroot directory is created as follows:
#
#   * //build/config/fuchsia:source_deps is in deps blocking build/rebuild of
#     target that does compilation.  Its deps suffice to compile and/or link
#     anything but an executable:
#
#     - :include keeps `include/` populated (and cleaned of stale files for
#      headers removed in an incremental build) using a Python script.  It gets
#      copies of all header files (the same files in every sysroot).
#
#     - :lib delivers each `lib/lib*.so` file in either of two ways:
#        1. Some `lib*.so` files are tiny linker script files with fixed
#           contents.  These are created via generated_file() targets, once at
#           `gn gen` time.  Until those contents are changed in GN, repeated
#           regenerations won't cause relinks by dirtying link inputs.
#        2. ELF linking stubs are created by ifs_shared_library() targets.
#           There is one `llvm-ifs` build step for each file across all
#           toolchains for each $current_cpu, which is copied (hard-linked)
#           into each sysroot.  Changes to `.ifs` files that don't change the
#           ELF contents won't cause relinks by dirtying link inputs.
#
#   * //build/config/fuchsia:link_deps is in deps blocking build/rebuild of any
#     linking target.  Its deps are needed before an executable can be linked
#     (without `-nostartfiles`).  This ideally would be in :executable_deps
#     instead, but the RBE link wrapper requires the startfiles to be present
#     for all link steps, not just for executables (which could ever use them,
#     while other kinds of link steps never do).
#
#     - :startfiles delivers the `lib/Scrt1.o` file via libc's build rules.
#       It's a copy (hard link) of the actual build location, and relinks
#       will be triggered only when it gets recompiled from source.
#
# Note that these targets never directly contribute any link inputs to the
# GN/Ninja build graph, nor any configs or suchlike that would affect any
# compilation or link step's command line.  They just constitute order-only
# deps to ensure that their respective sysroot files are fully up to date.
# Triggering recompiles for changed header files in the sysroot depends
# entirely on the depfile from the compiler.  Triggering relinks for changed
# link inputs in the sysroot depends entirely on the depfile from the linker.
#
# By the same token, the order-only deps mean that a compilation step that uses
# `-nostdinc` or otherwise never reads a sysroot header file will _wait_ for
# the sysroot headers to be brought up to date, but won't be recompiled
# unnecessarily.  A linking step that uses `-nostdlib` and/or `-nostartfiles`
# or otherwise never reads a sysroot link input will _wait_ for some sysroot
# link inputs to be brought up to date, but it won't be relinked unnecessarily.
#
# The Rust compiler uses the `lib/` files in much the same way that the C/C++
# compiler does, and they both use the same linker.  Rust-based builds may also
# invoke the C/C++ compiler and thereby use the `include/` files as it does.
#
# The Go compiler is somewhat more finnicky about its link inputs.  But the
# linker scripts in this sysroot are empty except for comments, which Go
# doesn't mind.  The other link inputs are ELF files.  The Go compiler may or
# may not use `lib/Scrt1.o` and won't use `include/` files, but it can use the
# ELF linking stubs found in `lib/lib*.so` files.

# Collect the scope definitions that list all sysroot headers.

# Generate the "$target_gen_dir/include" directory by parsing the
# sysroot_entries list of scopes.
#
# For historical reasons, only the scopes with an `sdk` key are considered
# here. Each value associated with an `sdk` key is a scope itself, with the
# following schema:
#
# If `include_dir` is present then:
#
#   include_dir (optional)
#     [GN path] A GN path to a subdirectory containing zero or more headers
#     to copy to the sysroot's include directory.
#
#   headers (optional)
#     [list of paths] Required if `include_dir` is specified, ignored otherwise.
#     A list of header sub-paths, relative to `include_dir`, that must be
#     copied to the sysroot directory.
#
#   no_export (optional)
#     [boolean] Ignored if `include_dir` is not used. A flag that is set to
#     indicate that the set of headers described in the current entry should
#     not be exported to the SDK sysroot (though they will still be copied
#     to the platform's sysroot). This is useful for <zircon/device/*.h>
#     headers, as well as `testonly-cdecls.inc`.
#
# Otherwise, if `include_dir` is _not_ present:
#
#   source (optional)
#     [path] A path, relative to the current root build directory, where
#     to find the source file to be copied into the sysroot, where destination
#     is specified by one of the ` link`, `debug` or `dist` keys described
#     below. Ignored if `include_dir` is present.
#
#   debug (optional)
#   dist (optional)
#   link (optional)
#     [path] A path relative to the sysroot directory, that specifies where
#     the `source` file needs to be copied into the SDK. Only one of these
#     keys can be used per entry. For the platform SDK, onle `dist` and `link`
#     are used. The SDK sysroot will use all three though.
#
#   deps (optional)
#     [list of labels] A list of labels to dependencies for this entry,
#     this should correspond to the GN target that built the `source`
#     file, once the sysroot generation is moved to the Fuchsia build.
#

# The flat list of files relative to include/ is collected here.  For each
# file, a generated_file() target generates an `#include "../..."` header that
# acts as a "redirector".  The labels of all these targets are collected too,
# along with any labels from `sdk.deps`.
