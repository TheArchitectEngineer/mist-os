//! Library to allow storing enum discriminants out-of-line from payloads without maintaining
//! `unsafe` code. Makes structs smaller when they have enum fields whose discriminants are stored
//! with padding in the enum layout due to payload alignment requirements.
//!
//! An enum's internal padding can result in a lot of memory used even when the use case does not
//! require the ability to return a concrete reference to the enum type. This macro allows relaxing
//! the requirement at the expense of ergonomics, storing enum discriminants in bytes of a struct
//! that would otherwise be used by the compiler for padding. Callers then interact with the enum
//! "field" through generated accessors.
