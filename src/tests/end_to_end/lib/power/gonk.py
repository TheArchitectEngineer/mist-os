        Create a new GonkSample based on a single line of CSV data.

        Args:
          `vals`: Sequence of strings representing a single sample. See below for format.
          `prev_time`: Time of the previous measurement, used to calculate this sample's
                       timestamp based on its delta_micros (microseconds since last sample).

        The vals list gets parsed as [host_time, delta_micros, samples..., comment].

        - `host_time` is a formatted time string. See implementation for parsing.
        - `delta_micros` is an integer string representing microseconds since the last sample.
        - `samples` are floating point strings in multiples of 3 (voltage, current, power).
        - `comment` is an arbitrary string. See implementation for parsing.

        The vals list format generally follows either of 2 archetypes: Sample or Comment.

        - *Sample* contains strings for host_time, delta_micros, samples. Comment string is empty.
        - *Comment* contains strings for host_time, delta_micros, comment. Sample strings are empty.

        Examples:

        - ['20240927 18:00:23.609548', '286', '0.8148437500000001', '1.010546875', '4.894726562500001', ... , '']
