/// Start and run a bridged wlansoftmac driver hosting an MLME server and an SME server.
///
/// The driver is "bridged" in the sense that it requires a bridge to a Fuchsia driver to
/// communicate with other Fuchsia drivers over the FDF transport. After the bridged
/// driver starts successfully, `run_start_completer` will be called with `start_completer`.
/// If the bridged driver does not start successfully, this function will return a
/// non-`ZX_OK` status.
///
/// This function returns `ZX_OK` only if shutdown completes successfully. A successful
/// shutdown only occurs if the bridged driver receives a
/// `fuchsia.wlan.softmac/WlanSoftmacIfcBridge.StopBridgedDriver` message and the subsequent
/// teardown of the hosted server succeeds.
///
/// In all other scenarios, e.g., failure during startup, while running, or during shutdown,
/// this function will return a non-`ZX_OK` value.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// This function is unsafe for the following reasons:
///
///   - This function cannot guarantee `run_start_completer` is thread-safe.
///   - This function cannot guarantee `start_completer` points to a valid object when
///     `run_start_completer` is called.
///   - This function cannot guarantee `run_shutdown_completer` is thread-safe.
///   - This function cannot guarantee `shutdown_completer` points to a valid object when
///     `run_shutdown_completer` is called.
///   - This function cannot guarantee `wlan_softmac_bridge_client_handle` is a valid handle.
///
/// By calling this function, the caller promises the following:
///
///   - The `run_start_completer` function is thread-safe.
///   - The `start_completer` pointer will point to a valid object at least until
///     `run_start_completer` is called.
///   - The `run_shutdown_completer` function is thread-safe.
///   - The `shutdown_completer` pointer will point to a valid object at least until
///     `run_shutdown_completer` is called.
///   - The `wlan_softmac_bridge_client_handle` is a valid handle.
