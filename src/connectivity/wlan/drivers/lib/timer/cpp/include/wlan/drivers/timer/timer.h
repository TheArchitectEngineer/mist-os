// timer object will first stop the timer. Note that StartPeriodic, StartOneshot and Stop are
// synchronous. Therefore the caller should be careful about holding locks that would prevent a
// timer trigger from completing when calling these methods. I.e. if the timer is in the middle of
// calling the callback and the callback is blocked on a lock held by the thread calling
// StartOneshot, StartPeriodic or Stop then those methods will never return.
//
// Calls to StartPeriodic, StartOneshot and Stop are mutually exclusive with eachother. If multiple
// threads call into these methods at the same time they will be processed sequentially and the
// order in which they are scheduled will determine the outcome.
