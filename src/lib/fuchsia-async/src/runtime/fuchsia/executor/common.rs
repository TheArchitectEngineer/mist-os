    /// There are pros and cons to both strategies. For (a), tokio encourages (but doesn't
    /// enforce [3]) type-safety by vending weak pointers, but those add runtime overhead when
    /// upgrading pointers. For (b) the difference mostly stand for "when is it safe to use IO
    /// objects/receivers". Tokio says it's only safe to use them whenever a guard is in scope.

    /// This acts as a prelude to the panic encoded in Executor::drop when receivers haven't
