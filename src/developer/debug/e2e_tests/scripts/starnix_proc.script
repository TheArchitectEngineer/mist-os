[zxdb] b sys_exit_group
Software breakpoints in starnix kernel are currently not supported. This breakpoint has been converted to a hardware breakpoint.
Hardware breakpoints can be specified on the command line:
	break --type execute sys_exit_group
See `help break` for details and follow https://fxbug.dev/396421111 for updates on enabling software breakpoints in starnix_kernel.

# Zxdb can unwind into restricted stack.
# TODO(https://fxbug.dev/395638033): Remove force-remote-unwind when the stripped binaries are
# shipped along with the debug info for the starnix container's (linux) prebuilt libc. This is only
# relevant here since there's a linux libc call on the stack in this test case that we cannot unwind
# through to get to the linux portion of the stack. The other starnix e2e tests don't need this
# because they don't have libc calls on the stack so unwinding using local debug info is enough.
[zxdb] frame --force-remote-unwind
# When optimization is on, there might be other inlined frame so we only check
# the existence of sys_exit_group and main function in the backtrace.
