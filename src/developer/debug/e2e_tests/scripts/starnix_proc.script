# Zxdb can unwind into restricted stack.
# TODO(https://fxbug.dev/395638033): Remove force-remote-unwind when the stripped binaries are
# shipped along with the debug info for the starnix container's (linux) prebuilt libc. This is only
# relevant here since there's a linux libc call on the stack in this test case that we cannot unwind
# through to get to the linux portion of the stack. The other starnix e2e tests don't need this
# because they don't have libc calls on the stack so unwinding using local debug info is enough.
