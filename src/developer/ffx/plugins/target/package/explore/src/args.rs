If additional binaries are provided via --tools, they will be loaded into .dash/tools/<pkg>/<binary>
The path is set so that they can be run by name. The path preference is in the command line order
of the --tools arguments, ending with the built-in dash tools (/.dash/tools/debug-dash-launcher).

--tools URLs may be package or binary URLs. Note that collisions can occur if different URLs have
the same package and binary names. An error, `NonUniqueBinaryName`, is returned if a binary name
collision occurs.
