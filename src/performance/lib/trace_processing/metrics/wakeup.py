    Computes time taken for the device to process a "wakeup", as defined by
    the provided series of trace events.

    A wakeup sequence is specified by a list `event_names` of length N. A sequence is defined as
    follows:
    - All events in the sequence are duration events.
    - The sequence begins at the end of an event named `event_names[0]`.
    - The sequence is completed when all further events are observed in a strict sequence, with
      an instance of `event_names[i+1]` beginning strictly after an instance of `event_names[i]`,
      for each i in range(0, N-2).
    - A second instance of `event_names[0]` cannot occur between the instance of `event_names[0]`
      that begins a sequence and the instance of `event_names[N-1] that ends it.
