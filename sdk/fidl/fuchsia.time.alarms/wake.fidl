/// [Wake] provides setting up platform-wide wake alarms.
///
/// An alarm is a promise made by the system to the caller of the API to notify
/// the caller that AT LEAST a certain amount of time has expired. The alarm
/// may fire later than the requested amount of time at the discretion of the
/// server implementing this API.
///
/// When this notification happens, we say that the wake alarm has "fired".
///
/// A "wake" alarm firing also ensures that the system comes back from a reduced
/// power state if needed, so that it can notify the caller.
///
/// The general shape of a wake alarm API has three parts:
/// * A specification of when a wake alarm is supposed to fire,
/// * A way to notify the caller of an alarm that fired, and
/// * A way to keep the system awake until both the caller and the callee have
///   completed work associated with the alarm.
