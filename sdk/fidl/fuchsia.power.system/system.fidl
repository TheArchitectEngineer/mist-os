/// # Usage
///
/// To prevent system suspension, a component can create an assertive dependency
/// using the `assertive_dependency_token` from `ApplicationActivity`. If the
/// dependency causes the power level of `ApplicationActivity` to be raised to
/// [`fuchsia.power.system/ApplicationActivityPowerLevel.ACTIVE`], SAG  will not
///  trigger system suspension until their power levels drop to `INACTIVE`.
///
/// If a component is managing a power element that requires the platform to be
/// in a specific state, an opportunistic dependency can be created on
/// `ExecutionState`. When `ExecutionState` changes its power level, all
/// dependent power elements will power down first. Ideally, this forces the
/// entire system into a configuration with a lower power consumption as the
/// power level of `ExecutionState` decreases.
