// call to `Start()` returns, the system will keep running until after `End()`
// is called or the instance is dropped. Users can use the same instance to
// perform multiple atomic operations, for example by calling `Start()` after
// `End()`.
//
// If doing multiple atomic operations, a single `ManualWakeLease` can have
// performance advantages over using a WakeLease directly because the
// `ManualWakeLease` monitors system state over its lifetime, allowing it to
// avoid certain operations vs a series of shorter-lived `WakeLease` instances.
