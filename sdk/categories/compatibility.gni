# Incompatible marker lists.
#
# The following are lists of IDK category markers for categories that are
# *incompatible* with the named IDK category. Add the list corresponding to a
# target's SDK category to its `assert_no_deps` to ensure that no item in the
# target's dependency tree has a dependency on a marker for an incompatible
# category. In other words, to ensure that the target does not have a dependency
# on a target in one of the incompatible IDK categories.
#
# Note: `assert_no_deps` entries appear to apply to all toolchains unless one
# is explicitly specified in the entry. This is important because the markers
# may be applied on any toolchain. Thus, it is critical that no toolchain be
# specified in these lists.
#
# For each category:
# 1. Initialize marker incompatibility lists to all markers.
# 2. Remove the compatible markers from the list.
