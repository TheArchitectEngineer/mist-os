# Power Framework Examples

Examples that demonstrate power concepts.

Get started by adding power examples to your `fx args`:

```
fx set core.x64 --with //examples/power --with-test //examples/power:hermetic_tests
```

Make sure to run `fx build` and `fx serve` if it's your first time setting up these examples.

You can then run all example tests using `fx test`.
