# Every new addition to this gni file is an instance of tech-debt that must be
# cleaned up to have a proper platform+product interface. If you need to add a
# specific artifact to the core product, please consider adding it to:
#
# //products/minimal/BUILD.gn
#
# If the artifact is incapable of being put inside that location, reach out to
# the assembly team for guidance: //src/lib/assembly/OWNERS. The assembly team
# may allow an exception so that artifacts can be added directly to this file,
# but each entry needs a ticket assigned to the assembly team with an agreed
# upon solution for how to address the tech-debt.

# This `minimal` product is intended to be the "smallest thing we'd still call Fuchsia," which
# implies simplicity, security, updatability and performance. Importantly, that differs from "all
# current products use this feature;" today, that is what the `core` product is for.
# `minimal` will change over time, both by addition and subtraction -- for example, should the
# team ship a mechanism for updating Fuchsia that does not require IP networking, that functionality
# should be moved to a higher-level product definition.
